# MAGIC # Question 1: Distributed Graph Processing
# MAGIC Chapter 5 from Lin & Dyer gave you a high level introduction to graph algorithms and concernts that come up when trying to perform distributed computations over them. The questions below are designed to make sure you captured the key points from this reading and your async lectures. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q1 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Give an example of a dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph. What are the nodes/edges in this dataset? Is the graph you describe 'directed' or 'undirected'? What would the average "in-degree" of a node mean in the context of your example? 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Other than their size/scale, what makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm? *(__HINT__: Do not respond in terms of any specific algorithm. Think in terms of the nature of the graph datastructure itself).*
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Briefly describe Dijskra's algorithm (goal/approach). What specific design component makes this approach hard to parallelize?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ How does parallel breadth-first-search get around the problem that you identified in part `c`? At what expense?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Q1 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ One example of a dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph is a public transportation system, such as the New York subway system. The nodes are the different subway stations and the edges represent routes that run between each station. In general this graph is undirected because if a train goes from one station to another, it can usually go the opposite direction as well. However, there could be situations from construction or track work where a train can only run one direction along a track. The average in degree of a node would represent how many other stations are connected to a given station. In the example of the New York subway system, a high in degree node would likely be a center station where many other lines connect. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The map reduce paradigm requires any map reduce algorithm to be stateless in nature, however a number of graph algorithms require the tracking of some sort of global state. Rather than using some sort of data structure to track the current traversal state of a graph, map reduce graph algorithms maintain a search frontier representing the state of the current node being expanded upon. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ The goal of Dijkstra's algorithm is to find the shortest path between nodes of a graph. The algorithm begins setting distances to all nodes that aren't the starting node to infinity, and maintaining a priority queue of vertices with priorities equal to the distance. The algorithm then iteratively selects the node with the lowest distance from the priority queue, and then traverses the neighbors to see if any of the nodes can be reached with a path of shorter distance. The priority queue makes it difficult to parallelize.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ Parallel breadth first search gets around the issue of the priority queue by passing over every node in the graph and iteratively outputting a key-value pair with the distances to each node that hasnâ€™t been visited yet. A reducer is then used to select the shortest path. The main expense is that you need to traverse every node in order to identify the shortest path.

# MAGIC # Question 2: Representing Graphs 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In class you saw examples of adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs. These data structures were probably familiar from HW3, though we hadn't before talked about them in the context of graphs. In this question we'll discuss some of the tradeoffs associated with these representations. __`NOTE:`__ We'll use the graph from Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer as a toy example. For convenience in the code below we'll label the nodes `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` instead of $n_1$, $n_2$, etc but otherwise you should be able to follow along & check our answers against those in the text.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q2 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Relatively speaking, is the graph you described in Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer "sparse" or "dense"?  Explain how sparsity/density impacts the adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of a graph.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Run the provided code to create and plot our toy graph. Is this graph directed or undirected? Explain how the adjacency matrices for directed graphs will differ from those of undirected graphs.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_matr()`.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_list()`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Q2 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ The graph described in Figure 5.1 in Lin and Dyer is sparse. The more dense a graph, the more memory required to represent an adjacency matrix, and the more compelling it is to represent the graph as an adjacency matrix. The number of nodes in a graph define the size of the adjacency matrix, where as both the size and sparsity of the graph define the size of the adjacency lists.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The graph is directed. The adjacency matrix for an undirected graph will always mirror across the diagonal of the matrix, whereas a directed matrix can have a 1 in position i,j but a 0 in position j,i or vice versa.

# MAGIC # Question 3: Markov Chains and Random Walks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q3 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ It is common to explain PageRank using the analogy of a web surfer who clicks on links at random ad infinitum. In the context of this hypothetical infinite random walk, what does the PageRank metric measure/represent?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ What is the "Markov Property" and what does it mean in the context of PageRank?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ A Markov chain consists of $n$ states plus an $n\times n$ transition probability matrix. In the context of PageRank & a random walk over the WebGraph what are the $n$ states? what implications does this have about the size of the transition matrix?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code + short response:__ What is a "right stochastic matrix"? Fill in the code below to compute the transition matrix for the toy graph from question 2. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) code + short response:__ To compute the stable state distribution (i.e. PageRank) of a "nice" graph we can apply the power iteration method - repeatedly multiplying the transition matrix by itself, until the values no longer change. Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. How many iterations does it take to converge? Which node is most 'central' (i.e. highest ranked)? Does this match your intuition? 
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 1:`__ _this is a naive approach, we'll unpack what it means to be "nice" in the next question_.
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 2:`__ _no need to implement a stopping criteria, visual inspection should suffice_.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Q3 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ Using the infinite random walk, we can develop a probability distribution over nodes in the graph (the webpages) to represent the likelihood that a user is on a webpage. In essence, PageRank is the visit rate to a page over an extended period of time. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The "Markov Property" refers to the fact that stochastic processes are memoryless. This means that future states don't depend on previous states - They only depend on the current state. In the context of PageRank, the web surfer can only pick which page to go to next based on the page he's on currently.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ The n states are each web page (each node of the graph). The transition matrix is a square matrix which has as many rows and as many columns as there are web pages. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ A right stochastic matrix is a square matrix where each row sums to 1.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ The matrix does not converge after 7 iterations, but does converge around 43 iterations. The most central node is node E, which makes sense since it's the only node with four connections: 2 in and 2 out.

# MAGIC # Question 4: Page Rank Theory
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Seems easy right? Unfortunately applying this power iteration method directly to the web-graph actually runs into a few problems. In this question we'll tease apart what we meant by a 'nice graph' in Question 3 and highlight key modifications we'll have to make to the web-graph when performing PageRank. To start, we'll look at what goes wrong when we try to repeat our strategy from question 3 on a 'not nice' graph.

Fill in the missing code to compute its transition matrix & run the power iteration method from question 3. What is wrong with what you see?

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__  Identify the dangling node in this 'not nice' graph and explain how this node causes the problem you described in 'a'. How could we modify the transition matrix after each iteration to prevent this problem?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ What does it mean for a graph to be irreducible? Is the webgraph naturally irreducible? Explain your reasoning briefly.

# MAGIC ### Q4 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ The power iteration is not converging but values are getting very very small. The problem is that there is a dangling node - As a result, we don't have a right stochastic matrix since one of the rows is just 0's.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The dangling node is 'E'. Once the user enters this node, it's impossible to exit. We could modify the transition matrix after each iteration by replacing 0's with an equal split of the probabilities for each other node, which is basically giving the user the ability to randomly jump to a different node instead of getting stuck in 'E'.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ In an irreducible graph, there is a path from every node to every other node. The webgraph is not naturally irreducible since most web pages that don't link to every other web page in the graph. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ In an aperiodic graph, the period (or greatest common divisor) of all cycle lengths is 1. This means that you can reach any node in an even or odd number of steps. The webgraph could be periodic assuming each page can link back to itself.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ PageRank modifies the graph with a Random Jump factor. PageRank adds a small amount of probability to each node to teleport to any other node. If we had a random surfer, this would be like the surfer randomly visiting a different page, even if they're not connected.

The number of intermediate records required to update PageRank is related to the number of edges in the graph. In this question you'll compute the average number of hyperlinks on each page in this data and visualize a distribution for these counts (the out-degree of the nodes). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q6 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) code:__ In the space provided below write a Spark job to stream over the data and compute all of the following information:
# MAGIC  * count the out-degree of each non-dangling node and return the names of the top 10 pages with the most hyperlinks
# MAGIC  * find the average out-degree for all non-dangling nodes in the graph
# MAGIC  * take a 1000 point sample of these out-degree counts and plot a histogram of the result. 
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ In the context of the PageRank algorithm, how is information about a node's out degree used?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ What does it mean if a node's out-degree is 0? In PageRank how will we handle these nodes differently than others?
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC __`NOTE:`__ Please observe scalability best practices in the design of your code & comment your work clearly. You will be graded on both the clarity and the design.

# MAGIC ### Q6 Student Answers:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ In the context of the PageRank algorithm, node's out degree information is used to get the number of dangling node and to rank the node.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ If a node's out-degree is 0, it means that the node has no outgoing edges. This node is called the dangling node. No key-value pairs will be emitted when a dangling node is encountered in the mappers, so the total PageRank mass will not be conserved. Possible treatment for these nodes is to redistribute the weights across all nodes in the graph evenly.

# MAGIC # Question 7 - PageRank part 1 (Initialize the Graph)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One of the challenges of performing distributed graph computation is that you must pass the entire graph structure through each iteration of your algorithm. As usual, we seek to design our computation so that as much work as possible can be done using the contents of a single record. In the case of PageRank, we'll need each record to include a node, its list of neighbors and its (current) rank. In this question you'll initialize the graph by creating a record for each dangling node and by setting the initial rank to 1/N for all nodes. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __`NOTE:`__ Your solution should _not_ hard code \\(N\\).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q7 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ What is \\(N\\)? Use the analogy of the infinite random web-surfer to explain why we'll initialize each node's rank to \\(\frac{1}{N}\\). (i.e. what is the probabilistic interpretation of this choice?)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Will it be more efficient to compute \\(N\\) before initializing records for each dangling node or after? Explain your reasoning.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that:
# MAGIC   * parses each input record
# MAGIC   * creates a new record for any dangling nodes and sets it list of neighbors to be an empty set
# MAGIC   * initializes a rank of 1/N for each node
# MAGIC   * returns a pair RDD with records in the format specified by the docstring
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Run the provided code to confirm that your job in `part a` has a record for each node and that your should records match the format specified in the docstring and the count should match what you computed in question 5. [__`TIP:`__ _you might want to take a moment to write out what the expected output should be fore the test graph, this will help you know your code works as expected_]

# MAGIC ### Q7 Student Answers:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __a)__ N is the number of nodes. We would like to model the behaviour of a infinite random surfer who is traversing the web by following any link going out from the page the surfer is currently on. This web-traversing behaviour follows an uniform distribution. The uniform probability is \\(\frac{1}{N}\\) at every web page state.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ Yes, it is more efficient to compute \\(N\\) before initializing records for each dangling node. This is because we can immediately compute the rank when initializing records for each dangling node.

# MAGIC # Question 8 - PageRank part 2 (Iterate until convergence)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Finally we're ready to compute the page rank. In this last question you'll write a Spark job that iterates over the initialized graph updating each nodes score until it reaches a convergence threshold. The diagram below gives a visual overview of the process using a 5 node toy graph. Pay particular attention to what happens to the dangling mass at each iteration.

# MAGIC __`A Note about Notation:`__ The formula above describes how to compute the updated page rank for a node in the graph. The $P$ on the left hand side of the equation is the new score, and the $P$ on the right hand side of the equation represents the accumulated mass that was re-distributed from all of that node's in-links. Finally, $|G|$ is the number of nodes in the graph (which we've elsewhere refered to as $N$).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q8 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ In terms of the infinite random walk analogy, interpret the meaning of the first term in the PageRank calculation: $\alpha * \frac{1}{|G|}$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ In the equation for the PageRank calculation above what does $m$ represent and why do we divide it by $|G|$?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Keeping track of the total probability mass after each update is a good way to confirm that your algorithm is on track. How much should the total mass be after each iteration?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that take the initialized graph as its input then iterates over the graph and for each pass:
# MAGIC   * reads in each record and redistributes the node's current score to each of its neighbors
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to add up the dangling node mass and redistribute it among all the nodes. (_Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration!_)
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to keep track of the total mass being redistributed.( _This is just for your own check, its not part of the PageRank calculation. Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration._)
# MAGIC   * aggregates these partial scores for each node
# MAGIC   * applies telportation and damping factors as described in the formula above.
# MAGIC   * combine all of the above to compute the PageRank as described by the formula above.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __a)__ The first term in the PageRank calculation represents the teleporting value with \\(\alpha =\\) 15% probability of random jump. \\(\frac{1}{|G|}\\) is the PageRank of dangling node. In essence, this means at a dangling node the random webpage jump with 15% probability can be modelled as the first term.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The m represents dangling mass and |G| represents the number of outbound links of a particular node. The reason we divide m by |G| is because we need to distribute the probability mass uniformly via outbound links to next nodes.
# MAGIC
